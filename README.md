Automated Cloud Optimization for CI/CD pipelines (GCP Cloud Run)

This project helps DevOps engineers evaluate Cloud Run deployment configs before deploying — by measuring:

runtime cost

CO₂ emissions

recommended optimized YAML

Risk Score (0–100) → can be used as CI/CD quality gate

recent deployment estimation history (click to restore)

🧩 Why this project?

Modern DevOps is no longer only speed.

Cost efficiency + sustainability + runtime optimization is critical.

With this dashboard:

“Before deploying → check if config is optimal.”
